      <p>Hello, my name is Melchior. In the past I posted various things on this blog, but decided to focus more on technical post. However, this does not mean that there is not something else to read here. I have also decided to write my posts in English in the future. Have fun reading my posts. They may also be useful for one or the other, even if I am now primarily writing them for myself in order to deepen topics.</p>
